# Bangalore House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python implementation of a linear regression model for predicting house prices in Bangalore. Before building the model, extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset.  The model is built using the scikit-learn library and has been fine-tuned using the best parameters.The repository includes the Jupyter notebook with the complete code, dataset, and a detailed explanation of the steps involved in the analysis and model building process.
